## About Me

I'm a Toronto-based data analyst with a background in business transformation, product development, consumer insights, and workflow automation. I specialize in making data actionable through exploratory data analysis, whether that involves surfacing retention patterns, building dashboards, or automating repetitive reporting. 

My analysis doesn't just show what's happening, it reveals why it matters and what to do about it. Stakeholders walk away ready to act, not just informed.

Naturally curious about everything from data anomalies to why my smart home automations work so well. Between projects, I'm usually exploring Toronto, discussing travel stories, or defending my pizza opinions.
