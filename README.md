## What's here 

Analyses and automations I've built to solve real problems, not just demonstrate techniques. Most of my work involves digging through data until the patterns start making sense, then building dashboards or automations so teams don't have to keep asking the same questions.

I work primarily in SQL, Python, Power BI, n8n, and UiPath, focusing on retention analysis and workflow automation. The goal is always the same: make the insight obvious and the action clear.

## What I'm building

This is where I share the approaches and scripts I keep coming back to. Real solutions for when data doesn't behave, reusable code that saves you from starting from scratch, and techniques I wish someone had shown me earlier.
If you're stuck on a tricky analysis or tired of manual reporting, there's probably something here that'll help.

## Background

Toronto-basedüçÅ. Spent years in business transformation and product development before focusing full-time on data. Outside of work, I'm tweaking smart home setups, always eager to talk pizza, or planning the next trip.
